### scrpyWireless.sh

Makes connecting/pairing to Wireless ADB and running srcpy to mirror your phone display to your PC a little bit less of a hassle.
**Requirements**
- srcpy

**usage:**
- Change the IP in the Script to the one on your Device, it's Static so it shouldn't change if you only ever use it in your local Network.
- (On e.g. Phone) Developer Mode and Wireless Debug mode needs to be enabled, the Pair Codes Port is different from your Devices Port. (entering the same IP with 2 different Ports (not static) twice and an additional Pairing Code in the terminal is annoying.)
